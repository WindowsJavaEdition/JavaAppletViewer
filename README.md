Java Applet Viewer
======
This is a program that allows you to quickly load the old and unsupported by now Java applets. 

It's written in VB.NET with a small bit of HTML.

Required software in order to run the program
------
You need:
- [Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 (or later)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3005 "Download")
- [Any update of Java 8 (later than Java 8 will not work, earlier than Java 8 may cause some problems)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jre8 "Download")

Building
------
Load the repository in Visual Studio/Visual Basic and you are good to go. 

Remember about the seperate `launcher.html` file when making your forks.

Windows Java
------
This is one of the software included in the Windows Java project. Still, you can use it in normal Windows or maybe even Linux with [Wine](https://www.winehq.org "Wine"). Fun fact: This project actually predates the revival of the Windows Java project.
